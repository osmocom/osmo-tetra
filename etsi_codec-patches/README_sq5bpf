Obtaining and compiling the tetra speech codec
(c) 2014 Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@lipkowski.org>

Please read the file README first, and also:
http://tetra.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/Speech_Codec

Modified instructions as of 20141118 (differs from the osmocom description,
the ETSI site looks different now):

In order to obtain the codec, follow the following procedure:

    * go to http://pda.etsi.org/
    * enter "en 300 395-2" as search term
    * execute the search, there should a result called "REN/TETRA-05059 "
    * click on the 'Download icon' link (zip-vice symbol)
    * you should now have a file called en_30039502v010301p0.zip 

The en_30039502v010301p0.zip file has 361169 bytes, and has the md5sum: 
a8115fe68ef8f8cc466f4192572a1e3e


For compiling please use only the codec.diff patch (which has all of the other patches
included + various other fixes), and compile in a 32-bit environment (64-bit segfaults).
